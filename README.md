# My think-cell test

<p>This is the Think-Cell test to implement interval_map class in C++</p>
<p>'interval_map<K,V>' is a data structure that associates keys of type K with values of type V. It is designed to be used efficiently in situations where intervals of consecutive keys are associated with the same value. Your task is to implement the assign member function of this data structure, which is outlined below</p>
